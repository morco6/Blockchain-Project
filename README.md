# Blockchain-Project
Wellcome to my "Blockchain and cryptocurrency Project".  
The project is mainly programmed in javascript (nodeJS) and AngularJS.  
Also Html, css, bootstrap, chart.JS.

## How to Initialize

1. You should open at least 2 ports: 
- npm run node_1 :heavy_check_mark:
- npm run node_2 :heavy_check_mark:
- npm run node_3 (optional)
- npm run node_4 (optional)
- npm run node_5 (optional)

2. Go to localhost:3001 and localhost:3002 (from different tab).

3. If you at 3001 port, go down to "הזמן חבר לרשת" and in the input add '3002'.

4. Now two peers connected to the blockchain network (3001,3002).

5. Go to "מפתחות" section and press the button to see the private/public Keys of the current port.

6. Now you can explore the functional of the system.

- **Notes:**
  - /blockchain - a json file which includes the entire block tree of the chain.
  - /mine - an action for mining purpose - displaying the mining result.  

Enjoy :wink:
